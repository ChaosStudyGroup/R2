1. install dpdk - using meson build and ninja install etc..

2. overwrite rte_memcpy.h as below
   sudo cp ./lib/librte_eal/common/include/generic/rte_memcpy.h /usr/local/include/rte_memcpy.h

3. Open /usr/local/include/rte_ether.h and in struct rte_ether_addr remove attribute aligned,
   that causes issues with bindgen and transitive repr(aligned) inclusions

3. Add the headers you want to ./headers.h

3. now run ./bindgen.sh
